    <b>Promise Yourself</b> 

    <p>To be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind.<br>

       To talk health, happiness and prosperity to every person you meet.<br>

       To make all your friends feel that there is something in them.<br>

        To look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true.
